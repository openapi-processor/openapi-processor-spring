*openapi-processor-spring* is an link:{openapi}[OpenAPI] interface & dto java code generator for link:{springboot}[Spring Boot].

It supports an approach where you explicitly define and document your Service API (using OpenAPI)with the Interface to the outside and its usage in mind before you implement it. You do not derive the API later from the implementation and its implicit design. (of course, adapt as you go...)

The advantages are:

* you have a single place to maintain the api which makes it easier to create a consistent api and keep the overview.
* it is easy to document in plain text. You can use Markdown in the OpenAPI `description` properties.

The processor generates java interfaces based on the endpoint description of the API and simple POJO  classes or records for parameter or response schemas defined in the API. The processor adds all the required  spring & jackson annotations to the interface, and all that is left to *you* is the implementation of the generated interfaces in any way you like.

The interfaces will help to keep the implementation in sync with the API. If anything relevant changes in the API, the interface changes and the compiler will warn that the interface is not implemented correctly.

The target programming language is Java. Therefore, the generated code is usable from most JVM languages.

See the xref:processor/index.adoc[processor intro] for a short example.

== Playground

openapi-processor has a link:{oap-playground}[playground, window="_blank"] application. You can try out some samples or your own YAML and view the code that the processor generates.

== Features

- generates **only java interfaces and java dto classes** (get/set POJOs or records) for all defined endpoints and schemas to allow full control of the endpoint implementation. It does not generate any other file. See xref:processor/index.adoc[processor].

- **powerful type mappings with generic support** to map schemas defined in the openapi.yaml to existing java types.
+
For example, to map the openapi `array` type to a different java collection or to map paging parameters and results to th Spring types like `Page<>` & `Pageable`.
+
mappings can be defined globally, for a specific response, parameter or endpoint and or http method (of an endpoint). See xref:mapping/index.adoc[type mapping].

- Annotation-based **WebFlux support**. Actually, there is *no* explicit WebFlux support, but the mapping allows defining a *single*, and a *multi* wrapper class. *single* wraps non-array like result types(e.g. `Mono<>`). *multi* replaces array like result types or parameters with the given multi mapping. For example, it will replace `List<String>` with `Flux<String>` if the multi mapping contains the fully qualified `Flux` type. +

- generates **human-readable code**.

- add **additional parameters** to an endpoint which are not defined in the OpenAPI description. For
example to pass a `HttpServletRequest` to the endpoint implementation. +
//[.badge .badge-since]+since 1.0.0.M6+

- supports **bean validations**. The constraints of the openapi description map to java bean validation annotations.
//[.badge .badge-since]+since 1.0.0.M6+

- allows **excluding endpoints** from generation. This is useful if the processor does not create the
correct code for an endpoint. That way the processor can still be used for all the other endpoints. +
//[.badge .badge-since]+since 1.0.0.M6+

- handle **multiple responses** by generating one endpoint method for each response content type. +
//[.badge .badge-since]+since 1.0.0.M11+

- the generated code does not use swagger annotations. There is no need to generate the
documentation from the code when the code originates from the documentation (i.e., an openapi.yaml).

- *maven & gradle support* The plugin docs show how to run a processor and how to add the generated sources to the build.

** xref:maven::index.adoc[openapi-processor-maven] plugin.
** xref:gradle::index.adoc[openapi-processor-gradle] plugin.

== Feedback

In case some feature is missing, or the generated code is not 100% what you would expect, create an link:{oaps-issues}[issue]. Preferably with a test case. Providing a test case will help significantly. :-)

A _perfect_ test case is a single folder with two subfolders containing the source files and the expected output files:

 my-test-case
 +--- inputs.yaml
 |--- inputs
 |    +--- mapping.yaml
 |    \--- openapi.yaml
 +--- generated.yaml
 \--- generated
      +--- api
      |    \--- Api.java
      \--- model
           \--- Foo.java

`inputs.yaml` and `generated.yaml` use the same simple format:

 items:
    - inputs/openapi.yaml
    - inputs/mapping.yaml

or

 items:
    - generated/api/Api.java
    - generated/model/Foo.java


The link:{oapc-inttests}[core project], and the link:{oaps-inttests}[spring processor] have a number of existing integration tests that can be used as examples.
