One (_classic_) way to structure our source code is to have several packages like `service`,  `repository`, `domain`, `dto` and `controllers` and have the code related to an endpoint distributed into those packages. For each endpoint.

The code gets structured by *layer*.

A drawback of structuring it by layer is that we usually work on a single endpoint. We are more interested in the *topic* of the endpoint and not its layer.

Therefore, an alternative way to structure our code is to group everything related to a single endpoint *topic* in the same package.

Everything in one place.

Not quite. Everything except the OpenAPI description, which is somewhere else.

Wouldn't it be nice to have the OpenAPI description of an endpoint in the same location?

The `package-name-from-path` option allows us to do that.
