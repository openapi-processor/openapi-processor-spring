= oneOf

Generating model classes from an `oneOf` has the challenge to handle a number of usually unrelated objects with different properties.

Java has no way to define a class member that can have multiple unrelated types (e.g. it can be of class `Foo` or class `Bar`), except using `Object`.

This is the default behavior of the processor.

The problem with `Object` is that it doesn't provide any information at all. You have to know (from the OpenAPI) what that `Object` could be.

To improve usability, the processor is able to generate marker interfaces to provide a bit more information than `Object`.

[.badge .badge-since]+since 2022.3+

Generation of marker interfaces is enabled by setting the `one-of-interface` option to `true` (See xref:processor/configuration.adoc[configuration]). For backward compatibility it is `false` by default.

The processor will now create a marker interface for a `oneOf` of  `object` s that is implemented by all `object` s in the `oneOf` list.

Here is an example. The response is an object `Foo` with a `foo` property that can have the type `Foo` or `Bar`.

        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Foo'
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Bar'

    # omitted description of Foo & Bar
----

The processor generates the class `Foo` as

[source,java]
----
// simplified
public class Foo {
    private FooOneOf foo;
}
----

with the type `FooOneOf` instead of `Object`. `FooOneOf` is the marker interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface FooOneOf {}
----

The two model classes `Foo` & `Bar` implement the marker interface:

[source,java]
----
// simplified
public class Foo implements FooOneOf { /* ... */ }
----

[source,java]
----
// simplified
public class Bar implements FooOneOf { /* ... */ }
----

Which is better than having `foo` just as `Object`. The marker interface helps to find the possible types of `foo`.
