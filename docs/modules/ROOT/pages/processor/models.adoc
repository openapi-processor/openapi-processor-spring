= Models

The processor will create simple POJOs classes for the `object` schemas used in the OpenAPI
description. A POJO will only have (annotated) properties and get/set methods for its properties.

The following api describes two endpoints:

- the first one `/book-inline` defines the response **schema** *inline*. This is interesting because
the  api does not provide a `schema` name.

- the second one `/book` references a **named schema**.

        title:
          type: string

The second endpoint uses a **schema** with name so the processor can simply create a POJO using the
name as the Java class name.

[source,java]
----
package generated.model;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;

public class Book {

    @JsonProperty("isbn")
    private String isbn;

    @JsonProperty("title")
    private String title;

    public String getIsbn () {
        return isbn;
    }

    public void setIsbn (String isbn) {
        this.isbn = isbn;
    }

    public String getTitle () {
        return title;
    }

    public void setTitle (String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

}
----

The first endpoint has no name so the processor invents a name based on the endpoint description.
In this case the name will be `BookInlineResponse200`. To create a unique name and avoid name
collisions  with other inline objects it is created by concatenating

* the path of the endpoint, `/book-inline` is mapped to `BookInline`
* `Response`, because it is an inline object described under `responses:`
* `200`, which is the the http status code of the response

which is finally the bulky `BookInlineResponse200`.

Apart from the generated name it will have exactly the same content (i.e. properties &
setter/getter) since the schema description is identical.
