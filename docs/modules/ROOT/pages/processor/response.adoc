= Responses

All generated endpoints return their java result type by default. This may be too simple for some endpoint implementations.

There are two mappings available to customize the result type:

. If, for example, the response needs some customization, we would like to use a `ResponseEntity<>` to modify it. This is possible using the *result* mapping.

. Another case is WebFlux, where we need the result to be either a `Flux<>` in case of an array type, or a `Mono<>` in case it is not an array type. This is possible using the *single* mapping.

NOTE: *single* and *result* mappings are _independent_, i.e., both mappings can be used at the same time. For example, it is possible to create a `Mono<>` result and modify the response using `ResponseEntity<>`. The response type would be `ResponseEntity<Mono<...>>`.

== result wrapper

//[.badge .badge-since]+since 1.0.0.M13+

A link:{spring-responseentity}[`ResponseEntity<>`] allows an endpoint implementation full control of the response.

Here is a super simple example:

[source,java]
----
public ResponseEntity<String> getFoo() {
    return ResponseEntity.ok("foo");
}
----

To enable a result wrapper set the `result` mapping in the mapping yaml to a fully qualified java type.

[source,yaml]
----
map:
  result: org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity
----

NOTE: The processor expects that it takes a single generic parameter.

Depending on the number of defined response content types the parameter of the `ResponseEntity<>` will be either the java type or the *unknown type*.

|===
|responses | ResponseEntity<>

|one
|`ResponseEntity<java type>`

|multiple
|`ResponseEntity<?>`
|===

NOTE: prior to 1.0.0.M13 all results were auto-wrapped with `ResponseEntity<>`.

See also xref:mapping/result.adoc[result mapping].

== single & multi wrapper

//[.badge .badge-since]+since 1.0.0.M13+

When using WebFlux, we want to wrap certain parameters and results types in reactive types like `Mono<>` or `Flux<>`.

To achieve this, the processor knows two special mappings:

* single: to wrap non-array types (i.e., not a collection)
* multi: to wrap array types (i.e., a collection)

=== multi

[source,yaml]
----
map:
  multi: reactor.core.publisher.Flux
----

Which will use `Flux<>` as collection wrapper instead of the original java collection type for all list *responses* (or *parameters*). The `multi` does not affect collections in model types.

=== single

To map non-array like responses to a `Mono<>` set the `single` mapping:

[source,yaml]
----
map:
  single: reactor.core.publisher.Mono
----

The processor will now wrap all non-array like response types with the given `single` mapping.
