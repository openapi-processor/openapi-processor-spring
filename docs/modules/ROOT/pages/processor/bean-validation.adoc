== WebFlux

The position of the `@Valid` annotation on reactive types has changed in 2024.2. Until then the `@Valid` was placed on the generic type of the reactive wrapper, like this:

[source,java]
----
    @PostMapping(path = "/foo-flux")
    void postFooFlux(@Parameter Flux<@Valid Bar> body);
----

Unfortunately, validation did not happen. Spring needs the `@Valid` annotation on the reactive wrapper to trigger the validation. Therefore `@Valid` is placed by default on the reactive wrapper:

[source,java]
----
    @PostMapping(path = "/foo-flux")
    void postFooFlux(@Parameter @Valid Flux<Bar> body);
----

To keep the old behavior see xref:processor/configuration.adoc#_compatibility[compatibility].
