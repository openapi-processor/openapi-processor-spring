== general

The processor will map identifiers used in the OpenAPI description (i.e. `yaml` file) to valid Java identifiers.

The Java identifiers will use camel case, starting with an upper case letter if it is a type name and a lower case letter if it is a variable name.

Camel case will be produced by detecting word breaks on special characters and using an upper case first letter on the next word. The special characters are:

* characters that are not allowed in java identifiers, (for example, a `-` (minus)). This is checked
 by using link:{java-char-start}[`Character.isJavaIdentifierStart()`] and
    link:{java-char-part}[`Character.isJavaIdentifierPart()`]

* `_` (underscore). The underscore is possible in java identifiers but usually not used apart from enums.

* a change from letter to number. (see table below).

given an identifier from the OpenAPI description, the processor would generate the following names for different kinds of identifiers:

|===
|                   |  OpenAPI       | camel case    | variable  | class      | enum

| since 2024.2
| foo2Bar
| foo2**B**ar
| foo2**B**ar
| Foo2**B**ar
| FOO2_BAR

| before 2024.2
| foo2Bar
| foo2bar
| foo2bar
| Foo2bar
| FOO2BAR
|===

== model

For properties of model classes, the properties will be annotated with `@JsonProperty` to provide the mapping from the OpenAPI identifier to the Java identifier.

[source,java]
----
    class Example {

        @JsonProperty("foo-bar")
        private String fooBar;

        // ...
    }
----

[NOTE]
====
The `@JsonProperty(...)` annotations are necessary in case a json property name is not a valid java identifier.

Any JSON identifier gets converted to a valid java identifier. If it differs from the JSON identifier, Spring (jackson) would be unable to correctly map the properties.

To avoid this issue, the processor adds the annotation.
