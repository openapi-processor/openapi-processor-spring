= package-names

[WARNING]
====
This is still a bit experimental and may not behave nicely if the expected configuration requirements are not met.

It also works *only* with the `INTERNAL` OpenAPI parser, which is the default OpenAPI parser.
====

== package-names-from-path

The `package-name-from-path` option enables the creation of package names based on the file location of $ref'erenced parts of the OpenAPI description.

Enabling this has a few requirements:

- `package-name` must match a specific *parent* package name of the target package in the production code.
+
The *parent* package should be shorter than the *target* package, and the *target* package should start with the *parent* package.
+
See the example below.

- to create an interface or resource with a specific package, its OpenAPI description has to be in the *target* package and must be reachable from the root OpenAPI description.

- it is only supported with the `INTERNAL` OpenAPI parser (it is the default parser). It will not work with the `SWAGGER` OpenAPI parser.

=== mapping.yaml

The first step is to enable the feature in the `mapping.yaml`:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+,title="mapping.yaml"]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: {var-mapping-version}

options:
  # this must be a parent package of the target packages
  package-name: io.openapiprocessor.samples  # <2>

  # this enables package generation from the endpoint $ref file location
  package-name-from-path: true # <1>
----

<1> this enables the package-name feature. Default is `false`.
<2> the `package-name`, this *must* be a *parent* package name of the project's *target* packages.

=== OpenAPI and $refs

The second step is to split the OpenAPI definition into multiple files and place them into the desired packages.

The `openapi.yaml` is placed into the usual place, in this example in the source folder `src/api`.

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+,title="openapi.yaml"]
----
openapi: {var-openapi-version}
info:
  title: openapi-processor-spring sample api
  version: 1.0.0

servers:
  - url: "https://openapiprocessor.io/\{path}"
    variables:
      path:
        default: api

paths:
  /foo:
    $ref: '../main/kotlin/io/openapiprocessor/samples/foo/foo.yaml' # <1>
----


The project directories so far look like this, where `sample` is the root folder of the project.

[title="directory structure, api"]
----
sample
\---- src
      \---- api
            +---- mapping.yaml
            \---- openapi.yaml
----

=== foo endpoint $ref

The `foo` path item in `openapi.yaml` $ref'erences the endpoint definition in `foo.yaml`.

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+,title="foo.yaml"]
----
post:
  tags:
    - foo
  summary: echo a Foo.
  description: simple sample endpoint
  requestBody:
    $ref: 'resources.yaml#/FooBody'
  responses:
    '200':
      description: foo
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: 'resources.yaml#/Foo'
----

`foo.yaml` is placed into the main source folder of the project into the *target* package the generated interface should have.

In this case the *target* package of `FooApi.java` will be `io.openapiprocessor.samples.foo`

The controller implementation and services for this endpoint will go into the same package.

`foo.yaml` also $ref'erences a `resources.yaml` file placed in the same package that defines the `Foo` payload schema:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+,title="resources.yaml"]
----
FooBody:
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: '#/Foo'

Foo:
  type: object
  description: Foo object description
  properties:
    foo:
      type: string
      maxLength: 10
      description: foo property description
    id:
      type: string
      format: uuid
      description: id property description
----

The final directory structure then looks like this:

[title="directory structure, api and sources"]
----
sample
\---- src
      +---- api
      |     +---- mapping.yaml
      |     \---- openapi.yaml
      \---- main
            +---- kotlin
            |     \---- io
            |           \---- openapiprocessor
            |                 \---- samples
            |                       +---- foo
            |                       |     +---- FooController.kt
            |                       |     +---- foo.yaml
            |                       |     \---- resources.yaml
            |                       +---- bar
            |                       |      \---- ...
            |                       \ Application.kt
            \---- resources
                  \---- application.properties
----

=== parent package name

Having an idea now how the files are organized, it is possible to explain which package is the *parent* package.

From the file tree above:

The package name of the `foo` endpoint files is `io.openapiprocessor.samples.foo` and the nearest *parent* package is `io.openapiprocessor.samples`. This is then the `package-name` option value.

It is possible to use `io.openapiprocessor` or even `io` as the *parent* package.

Important is that the *parent* package is shorter than the *target* package and that the *target* package starts with the *parent* package.

=== directory structure after processing

Assuming a Gradle build, the directory structure after processing is:

----
sample
+---- build
|     \---- openapi
|            +--- java
|            |    \---- io
|            |          \---- openapiprocessor
|            |                \---- samples
|            |                      +---- foo
|            |                      |     +---- Foo.java
|            |                      |     \---- FooApi.java
|            |                      \---- bar
|            |                            \---- ...
|            \---- resources
|                  \---- api.properties
\---- src
      +---- api
      |     +---- mapping.yaml
      |     \---- openapi.yaml
      \---- main
            +---- kotlin
            |     +---- io
            |     |     \---- openapiprocessor
            |     |           \---- samples
            |     |                 +---- foo
            |     |                 |     +---- FooController.kt
            |     |                 |     +---- foo.yaml
            |     |                 |     \---- resources.yaml
            |     |                 \---- bar
            |     |                       \---- ...
            \---- resources
                  \---- application.properties
----
