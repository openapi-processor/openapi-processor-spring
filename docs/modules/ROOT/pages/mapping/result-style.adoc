= Result Style
include::partial$links.adoc[]

The `result-style` configuration controls how the processor handles the return type of endpoint success and error response types if both are defined in the OpenAPI.

[source,yaml]
----
map:
  #result-style: success  # use the success result type, this is the default
  result-style: all # use an Object return type

  # result-style is available at endpoint & http method level.
  /foo:
    #result-style: success

    get:
      result-style: success
----

* **result-style** (optional).

** `success` ([.badge .badge-since]+default since 2021.5+): generates endpoint methods with the success response type even if it has error responses. This assumes that errors are reported by exceptions.

** `all` (default before 2021.5): generates endpoint methods with an `Object` return type if it has error responses.

** [.badge .badge-since]+since 2025.2+ `result-style` is available at the endpoint & http method level.
