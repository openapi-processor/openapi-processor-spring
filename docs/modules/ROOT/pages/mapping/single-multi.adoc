= (global) Single & Multi mapping

== single & multi wrapper

//[.badge .badge-since]+since 1.0.0.M13+

When using WebFlux we like to wrap certain parameters & results types in reactive types like `Mono<>` or `Flux<>`.

To achieve this, the processor knows two special mappings:

* `single`: to wrap a non-array like type (i.e., not a collection)
* `multi`: to wrap an array like type (i.e., a collection)


=== multi

[source,yaml]
----
map:
  multi: reactor.core.publisher.Flux
----

Which will use `Flux<>` as collection wrapper instead of the original java collection type for all
list *responses* (or *parameters*). `multi` does not affect collections in model types.

=== single

To map non-array like responses to a `Mono<>` set the `single` mapping:

[source,yaml]
----
map:
 single: reactor.core.publisher.Mono
----

The processor will now wrap all non-array like response types with the given `single` mapping.

== endpoint-specific mapping

it is also possible to configure `single` & `multi` on the xref:mapping/endpoint.adoc[endpoint level].


== single & multi with result mapping

It is possible to use `single` & `multi` mappings together with the `result` mapping, i.e. `ResponseEntity`.

`result` will wrap `single`

[source, java]
----
ResponseEntity<Mono<String>>
----

and `multi`

[source, java]
----
ResponseEntity<Flux<String>>
----

Unfortunately, if you need the reactive result to modify the http response, something like this:

[source, java]
----
// does not work
public ResponseEntity<Mono<Result>> someEndpoint() {
    return someBean.getResult()
           .map(r -> ResponseEntity
                   .ok()
                   .eTag(r.eTag())
                   .body(Mono.just(r)));
}
----

it will not work because the result type of the statement is `Mono<ResponseEntity<Mono<Result>>>` and not the expected `ResponseEntity<Mono<Result>>`. This can be fixed by modifying the `result` mapping to

[source, yaml,,subs="attributes"]
----
openapi-processor-mapping: {var-mapping-version}

options:
  # ...

map:
  # wrap the ResponseEntity with Mono
  result: reactor.core.publisher.Mono<org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity>

  single: reactor.core.publisher.Mono
  multi: reactor.core.publisher.Flux
----

which will now generate the endpoint signature as

[source, java]
----
public Mono<ResponseEntity<Mono<Result>>> someEndpoint() {
   // ...
}
----

and the above code will now work.

It is recommended to configure this on the endpoint level if you just need this for a few endpoints.
