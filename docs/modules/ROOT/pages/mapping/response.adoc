= (global) Response mappings

Global response mapping will replace the result type of the endpoint in the api description based on
 its **content type** to the given java type.

It is defined like below, and it should be added to the `map/responses` section in the mapping.yaml
which is a list of global response mappings.

A single global response mapping can have the following properties:

[source,yaml]
----
 - content: {content type}  =>  {target type}
   generics:
     - {a generic type}
     - {another generic type}
----

* **content** is required.

** **{content type}** is the name of the content type of the endpoint response that should be replaced
  by **{target type}**.

** **{target type}** is the fully qualified class name of the java type that should be used for all
endpoint content types **{content type}**.

* **generics** defines the list of types that should be used as generic type parameters to the
java type given by **{target type}**.

[CAUTION]
====
Since the processor will simply match the content type string take care that all responses of this
content type should really use the same type!

This is probably only useful for a vendor content types. Globally mapping the content type for
example of `application/json` does not look like a good idea.

== Example

Given the following (global) response mapping

[source,yaml]
----
map:

  # list of global response mappings, mapped by content type
  responses:
    - content: application/vnd.something => com.github.hauner.openapi.Something
----

and an openapi.yaml with multiple endpoints returning their result as content type
`application/vnd.something`

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: global response content type mapping example
  version: 1.0.0

paths:
  /do-something:
    get:
      responses:
        '200':
          description: response
          content:
            application/vnd.something:
              schema:
                type: string

  /do-something-else:
    get:
      responses:
        '200':
          description: response
          content:
            application/vnd.something:
              schema:
                type: string
----

the processor will use `com.github.hauner.openapi.Something` as java type for **all** responses with
the content type `application/vnd.something`.
